# Air-Quality-Drone

Air-Quality-Drone is an OOP software package written in Java that simulates a drone flying around air-quality sensors placed around a geographical area. The Drone calculates the most efficient path between all sensors, while avoiding buildings and keeping battery levels acceptably high.

It was made for a 3rd year project during my studies at the University of Edinburgh, and recieved a mark of 84/100.
